First add the following line to the .pro file:

CONFIG -= embed_manifest_exe

this will disable embedding of the default manifest file. After that it is necessary to add a windows resource file:

RC_FILE = f3d.rc

.rc file is usually included to embed version information into .exe, but as soon as manifest is also a part of the executable resources we could reference a custom manifest file in it, just add the following line into app_resources.rc:


1 24 f3d.exe.manifest

where 1 is the resource ID,
24 is the resource type - RT_MANIFEST
and f3d.exe.manifest is the file with our custom manifest.

If you don't need version info then app_resources.rc may contain just this single line.
